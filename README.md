## ReadMe `README.md` `README`

The ReadMe is usually the first document people will see of your project. Depending on your project it should give a **short** introduction and usage/build examples. It **should only contain the information you expect users to read**. It is usually possible to link to other documentation files using the **markdown syntax** which gets rendered as html by popular repository hosting platforms.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## When should I name the file ending in **.md**?

In general only files that end in `.md` will be renderd using markdown. So whenever you want to use markdown features that should be rendered visually (like headings/sections/lists/clickable links/bold/italic/...) you should use `.md`.
